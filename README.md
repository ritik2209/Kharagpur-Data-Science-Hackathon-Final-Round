# Kharagpur-Data-Science-Hackathon-Final-Round
### Result: Our Team Deep-Learners Won the Competition
#### It was a semantic image segmentation challenge containing multi-class segmentations (road, buildings, vegetation,Green farms,Dry farms, barren land, water body and other) and our task was to extract the vegetation class, which had a pixel density (255, 201, 0, 255)
Model Used : We used Different Pretrained Semantic Segmentation Models and Ensembled them to give the final prediction.<br />
